A world is a whole thing. It may be made of countless particles, but those particles are bound together, inseparably, sharing a fate they will all face together. The kind of resonance that occurs throughout a globe, the shockwaves passing through geological time like a ball of quivering fluid, unite these particles into a greater totality. This totality forms a receptive field -- it is sensitive to signals. It responds. It is as if this reverberative fabric generates something like a _mind_, a feeling, thinking, sensing _perspective_. 

Right now, for the world of Arel, that totality was horror. It saw, it _felt_, the star at the center of its universe, buckle. Every person, every creature, all at once registered a terrible drop in their gut, like the ground opened up and swallowed everything they knew, a vast and insatiable mouth. No one knew, logically, but they all _knew_, deep down, that the foundation of their existence had just been violently and irrevokably removed. A vertiginous falling sensation swept through the resonating body of the planet. An anguish rose, and the cry of the turning world took the form.... of a ship. An Ark. The Ark was born slick with their grief and also their hope, which could never be truly extinguished. The Ark was their body now, and the Ark waited, to become an arrow into the future, as the past crumbled in fire behind them.

The totality, continued.
