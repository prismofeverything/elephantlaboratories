Solar harvesting technology relies on a conjunction of independent breakthroughs, woven into a stream of endless (?) power. First, you have plasma induction, where a million massive wheels of crystalline ceramics spin in the roiling convection of the solar fabric, funneling energy into huge planet-sized capacitors. Second, energy-wave propagation axes, where the energy drawn from the spinning blades is transmitted at zero loss through space at the speed of light. Finally, you have lightning conduction networks, which capture and channel the propagating axis into a specific purpose or process, powering every energy-requiring activity at every level of scale throughout all the worlds of Sol. It is upon this basis that all of civilization currently operates.
SHIPPING RATES MEGAUPDATE
The main concern we've heard as feedback, and the primary activity since we've been engaged in since launch, is the improvement of shipping rates for a number of countries across the globe. Due to the resounding success of this campaign, we've been able to engage a number of different shipping options and are happy to say this improves the shipping situation for a number of existing and potential backers.
There are a couple wrinkles I hope we can work through together. First, if you already pledged at the higher rate, we can't change it for you. You will have to update your pledge in the newly created shipping region for your country. We found a helpful guide for how to do this: https://help.kickstarter.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005126814-How-can-I-change-my-pledge-amount-or-reward-selection- If this doesn't work for you, re-pledging should fix it. Send us a message if you have any problems, we'll see how we can help. 
Second, we were informed that we are unable to collect VAT for 4 specific EU countries (it's against the law?):
* Switzerland
* Luxembourg
* Iceland
* Norway
So we are going to make a rate specific to these non-VAT EU countries. If you are pledging from these countries, *you will still have to pay VAT to receive any pledge!* We thought we could do this for everyone, but it turns out everyone but these four countries. If you are from one of these four countries, please readjust your pledge to the new lower rate (choose the one for your country instead of general EU).
Okay, without further ado, here are the new rates:

Zone definitions are:
* Zone 1 - US, Canada, China, Hong Kong
* Zone 2 - UK, Australia, New Zealand (this is a huge reduction from ROW for AU/NZ....), and the EU countries we are not allowed to collect VAT from: Switzerland, Lichtenstein, Norway, Iceland. 
* Zone 3 - EU (VAT included), and various AP including Japan, Singapore, and Malaysia.
* Zone 4 - Various other countries including Martinique. 
* Zone 5 - Everyone else. 
I think it's an improvement. Enough of an improvement? That's up to you. Hope this makes (more) people happy (than were happy before), because in the end, happiness is the point.
INTERVIEW
We recently recorded a podcast interview with some new friends we made at PaxU at the end of November, The Discussion Phase with John and Matthew. Matt, Matt, John, and Ryan talk about the origins of Sol, game design philosophy, and what makes games awesome in general and Sol in particular. I speak in tongues (mostly English). Add it to the queue if you are interested: https://open.spotify.com/episode/1zZ01K2OYoUtrChJAySdOE?si=e90a1000fb744788
THANK YOU
The campaign has exceeded our wildest expectations. Thank you for everyone who believes in the game and in us, I hope your enjoying this special holiday edition campaign as much as we are.
In solar glory,
- Ryan
