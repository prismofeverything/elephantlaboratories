The inhabitants of Sideralis knew for centuries what was happening to the Sun. They had models and projections demonstrating clearly the instability the denizens of the inner worlds were incurring on the fragile solar structure. At one point they sent reports to the inner councils, pleading for action, offering alternatives.... but gave up centuries ago. Any contact with the inner worlds had deteriorated for so long they didn't even know who to contact anymore, even if they wanted to. They received none of the benefits of the ongoing solar harvesting, but they shared in all of its detriments. The prevailing of which was, in this case, total destruction of all of their tiny worlds here in the asteroid belt.

They had been preparing for over 14 decades now, and everything was ready. They were poised to launch, no longer even watching the life slowly drain from what was once their star. They shed these rocks like a shell they had outgrown, leaving the debris of their previous society behind without an afterthought. Deeper into the darkness they went, but really it was more the completion of an emigration already begun long ago, when they first reached out towards these dim outer worlds. Now, they were prepared to live entirely between stars. They had learned to feast on emptiness itself, and it was finally time to leave their nest. Wings spread, they percolated into the in between spaces of the galaxy, and merged with the darkness. When humanity met them again, they would not even recognize them as human, a misunderstanding that would have far-reaching consequences into the future.

PRINT FILES READY

Hello everyone! Happy to announce we have made all updates to the rulebook, diagrams, and box, and the production files are ready for delivery. A quick list of improvements:
* We used all of the rules questions that seem to recur and made updates all throughout the rulebook to improve clarity on these points. One key example, it was unclear in the rules that you draw all instability cards at the end of your turn instead of action by action, so this has been called out in a number of places. Another key clarity issue here was the setup for vestigial structures, which is now decoupled from regular setup. Hopefully this will minimize confusion, especially for first time players.
* The convert diagram for foundries was updated to disambiguate the choice between which space to place the foundry. There was constant confusion about the visual language for vertical height corresponding to levels in the sun being broken for this diagram. Here is a before and after:

* As many of you may know if you have followed this project for awhile, Jodi Sweetman has played an utterly essential role in making Sol a reality. While me and my brother designed the core gameplay itself, Jodi was there all throughout the development/production/manufacture/fulfillment process making sure everything that needed to happen did happen. After countless conversations about gameplay adjustments and improvements over years of development, she has as much of her DNA in this game as anyone else. Simply, the project would not exist without her.

In honor of this, we've chosen to recognize her role by adding her name to the title on the top of the box and rulebook. It is really the least we could do, and I hope this goes some way to giving Jodi the recognition she deserves for this game. Join me in a round of applause: thank you Jodi. 

And in case you missed it, we are planning to send a copy of the new rulebook and diagrams out to all of our insert-only backers (who we are assuming have the first edition of the game and are not just buying an insert for a game they don't have.... I think the logic works here). 

INSERT REVOLUTION

Well everyone, I have a story for you. We started this project with a design for the insert.... honestly, my focus was on the game itself and I thought the insert would be a good addition for people who are into that. Since this point I ended up getting my hands on it, playing around with it, fitting it in the box, and dreaming of things it could be. And while the insert design we started with was great, I began to think of new things I wanted to do with it (!) I went from seeing the insert as a nice add on to being a part of the game itself, for those that opt in.

Needless to say, we have completely redesigned the insert from first principles along these lines, with the help of our friend Chris Walker. Instead of just being a way to store components, it can also be a way to organize and interact with the components during gameplay itself.

A brief list of features we added:
* Player pieces are stored in a tray that has their mothership icon on it.... this ends up pointing in the direction of orbit and reinforcing the visual flow present on the board.
* There are now two trays for energy cubes so they can live on either end of the table for easy access.
* The way the player holds and energy cube trays fit in the box now allows for the player boards to stack happily with everything else.
* The cards lay in a tray for each suit arranged diagonally to make it easy to pull out suits, and each suit icon is engraved in its corresponding tray.

Now you may say, this all sounds great, but what about the timeline?? Currently we are still on track for September delivery, and we are working furiously to make sure we hit that date. That said, there are a lot of things to work out with manufacturing (engraving vs screenprinting, staining, assembly instructions), and the main bottleneck is making adjustments and getting the new insert prototype back from the manufacturer. We have what I believe is the final design so I don't think we'll have to do any more back and forth on that, I just want to be as transparent about the process as possible. I can still imagine something coming up that could impact delivery by a month or so. If this happens, you will all be the first to know.

Until then, rest assured we are going to make it as awesome as possible. Can't wait to share it with everyone : )

THANK YOU

Thanks again! I hope you are enjoying the adventure as much as we are. Space is large, so it is a reassuring coincidence that we all live on the same planet and can make amazing things for each other. Trying to make the most of this opportunity. 

In solar majesty,
