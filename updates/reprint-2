Hello friends of Sol!

There are more of you than last time, we grow stronger every day. Thank you for all the messages and support, it means a lot to hear from you.

It was starting to feel like time for another update, so I thought I would let you know how things are progressing.

First off, I have finalized the dimensions and components for ORGANISM so I was able to submit the quote to Panda. They have a new automated quoting system being rolled out soon, which in the long run will make quoting much easier, even if I have to wait for that to complete to get the quote. They said some time in July, so expecting that any day now (SOL is already complete, so that quote is already with us). 

This is the next step in determining how much everything is going to cost, which will inform the funding goal. After we have a quote we will also have size/weight estimates, so I can get a shipping quote from Quartermaster. Once that's in, I can make the campaign public. Getting kind of excited (!) things are happening.

Also, wanted to mention that we will be making two versions of ORGANISM now, one with simpler wooden disks for pieces and the other deluxe version with sculpted 3d pieces, more like a chess set. The deluxe version was originally going to be the only version but I want as many people as possible to be able to play, and I think having a simpler more affordable version will lead to more people being able to get a copy, as well as travel-ability and shelf space. That also means I can make the ultimate version I've been seeing in my mind, and can go all out on every detail, and whoever wants that experience can opt in. 

So, I said the campaign would launch in the Summer of 2022 - that's looking more like the Fall now, but hopefully not too much longer. Thank you all for your kindness and enthusiasm! Can't wait to make this real : )

In solar energy,

Ryan
